Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a machine learning model to distinguish the species from each other.\n","\n","In this experiment, you will download the popular [IRIS dataset](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/netj/8836201/raw/6f9306ad21398ea43cba4f7d537619d0e07d5ae3/iris.csv), and open it using any text editor of your choice.
