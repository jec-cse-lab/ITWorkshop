The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.\n","\n","![Queue](https://www.techgig.com/files/nicUploads/215415368052929.png)\n","\n","In this experiment, you will create a queue in Python using an array.
