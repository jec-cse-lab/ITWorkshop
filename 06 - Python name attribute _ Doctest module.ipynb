However, Python interpreter runs the code right from the first line. The execution of the code starts from the starting line and goes line by line. It does not matter where the main function is present or it is present or not.\n","\n","Since there is no **main()** function in Python, when the command to run a Python program is given to the interpreter, the code that is at level 0 indentation is to be executed. However, before doing that, it will define a few special variables. **\\_\\_name\\_\\_** is one such special variable. If the source file is executed as the main program, the interpreter sets the **\\_\\_name\\_\\_** variable to have a value **\\_\\_main\\_\\_**. If this file is being imported from another module, **\\_\\_name\\_\\_** will be set to the module’s name.\n","**\\_\\_name\\_\\_** is a built-in variable which evaluates to the name of the current module.\n","\n","```\n","# Python program to demonstrate 'main' function \n","\n","print(\"Hello\") \n","\n","# Defining main function \n","def my_main(): \n","\tprint(\"hey there\") \n","\n","# Using the special variable __name__ \n","if __name__==\"__main__\": \n","\tmy_main() \n","```\n","---\n","---\n","# Modules in Python\n","\n","**What is a module?** Consider a module to be the same as a code library.

This module's functionality makes it possible to search for pieces of text that look like interactive Python sessions, and executes these sessions to see if they work exactly as shown.\n","\n","Doctest can be very useful in the following scenarios −\n","\n","*   To check that a module’s docstrings are up-to-date by verifying that all interactive examples still work as documented.\n","*   To perform regression testing by verifying that interactive examples from a test file or a test object work as expected.\n","*   To write tutorial documentation for a package, liberally illustrated with input-output examples\n","\n","**The following program would not run in Colab.
