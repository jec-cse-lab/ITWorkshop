Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.\n","\n","Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:\n","\n","1. **Python is Interpreted** − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.\n","\n","2. **Python is Interactive** − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.\n","\n","3. **Python is Object-Oriented** − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.\n","\n","4. **Python is a Beginner's Language** − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.\n","\n","# Introduction\n","\n","The first program that is usually executed when learnig a new language is the one that simply prints \"Hello World\" to the console. We will start our short course by executing a similar program.\n","\n","Unlike languages like C or Java, which would require several lines of codes to create a program to just print \"Hello World\", we can do that in Python in just one line."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"vdjZh2FH9v-E","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["print(\"Hello World\")"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LayjVvhK92gk","colab_type":"text"},"source":["To start the Python interpreter in your PC, just type\n","\n","```\n","#python\n","```\n","in the console.\n","\n","To execute a Python program in a file *file_name.py*, type\n","\n","\n","```\n","#python file_name.py\n","```\n","# Basic Syntax\n","In Python, instead of curly braces, indentation is used to differentiate a block of statements."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"UVxcBGjz-rxF","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["x = 1\n","if x == 1:\n","    # indented four spaces\n","    print(\"x is 1.\")"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8peAYP0T_1kv","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Variables and data types\n","In Python, every variable is an object.
